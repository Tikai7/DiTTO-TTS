## Introduction
Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) have shown high performance in various tasks such as image, audio, and video generation. When applied to Text-To-Speech (TTS), these models require domain-specific factors to ensure proper temporal alignment between text and speech. However, this dependency complicates data preparation and limits model scalability.

DiTTo-TTS introduces a novel approach to overcome these limitations while achieving high performance. This method is based on a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture and integrates a speech length predictor.

## Model Components

### Speech Length Predictor
- Predicts the total length of the audio signal for a given text.
- The encoder transforms the text bidirectionally.
- The decoder takes encoded audio (NAC) as input and applies a causal mask.
- Cross-attention between encoded text and audio enables length prediction.
- Trained separately using cross-entropy loss.

### Neural Audio Codec (NAC)
Encodes audio signals into latent representations aligned with the text, quantizes them, and then decodes them.

**Components:**
- Encoder
- Vector Quantizer
- Decoder
- Language Model

### Diffusion Model
- Generates speech from textual representations \( z_{text} \) and audio \( z_{speech} \) using a diffusion process.

### Audio-Text Pipeline
- **Dataset:** MLS Librispeech â€“ 10,000 selected French audio samples with text transcriptions.
- **Preprocessing:**
  - **Text:** Tokenization (GPT2, ByT5).
  - **Audio:** Resampled to 24kHz.
- **Audio Signal Reconstruction:** BigVGAN.
